<h1> Platform module </h1>
<h3> functions: </h3>
	platform.WallClock() -> float: 
		This function returns the current time in seconds.

	platform.Log(message : str) -> None:
		Prints to the debug console. If you are using the release mode executable, there will be no debug console.

	platform.SetCursor(cursorCode : int) -> None:
		This function takes in a cursor code and sets the cursor accordingly. Refer below to the possible cursor codes.

		0 -> Standard arrow
		1 -> Hand
		2 -> Double-pointed arrow pointing north and south
		3 -> Double-pointed arrow pointing west and east
		4 -> Double-pointed arrow pointing northeast and southwest
		5 -> Double-pointed arrow pointing northwest and southeast 
		
	platform.SetWindowName(windowName : str) -> None:
		This function sets the name of the window to be created.
<h3> attributes: </h3>
	platform.deltaTime : float
		The time in seconds that the last frame took.
	
	platform.mouseX : int
		The x position of the mouse in window coordinates
		
	platform.mouseY : int
		The y position of the mouse in window coordinates
		
	platform.keys : list
		List of tuples where each tuple corresponds to an input key on the keyboard.
		The format of each tuple is as such
		
		(isDown, wasDown)
			isDown : bool
				True if the user is pressing this key for this frame, False otherwise.
			wasDown : bool
				True if the user was pressing this key during the last frame, False otherwise.
				
		The indices of the tuples denote the specific keyboard key in a standard way.
		For example, the tuple at index 0 corresponds with the 'A' key. 
		The tuple at index 1 corresponds with the 'B' key, etc.
		The platform module has attributes which define these constants, they are listed below.
		
		platform.KEY_A
		platform.KEY_B
		platform.KEY_C
		platform.KEY_D
		platform.KEY_E

<h1> Storage module </h1>
	The storage module is an empty python object. It exists so that the user can store data that persists for the lifetime of their program.
<h1> backBuffer object </h1>
	The backBuffer object is a PIL.Image object as specified by the following <a target="_blank" href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html">documentation</a>.  
<h1> Callback functions </h1>
	AppPreInit(platform, storage):
		This function is called prior to the creation of the window. Therefore, it is the only time that functions such as platform.SetWindowName will have any effect.

	AppInit(platform, storage, backBuffer : PIL.Image):
		This function is called after the window is created and before the main application loop. It is called once.

	AppUpdateAndRender(platform, storage, backBuffer : PIL.Image):
		This function is called once for every frame. The application runs at 30 frames per second.

	AppClose(platform, storage, backBuffer : PIL.Image):
		This function is called after the main loop has finished. This happens when the user closes the window by pressing the 'X' in the upper right corner of the window.

	AppImport(platform, storage, imageName : str):
		This function is called after the user enters the name of the file that they would like to open as prompted by the window which appeared after they clicked the 'Import' button.
		The function is passed the name of the image, which is the exact string that the user entered into the open file prompt.  

	AppExport(platform, storage, backBuffer : PIL.Image, imageName : str):
		This function is called after the user enters the name of the file that they would like to save as pormpted by the window which appeared after they clicked the 'Export" button.
		The function is passed the name of the image, which is the exact string that the user entered into the save file prompt.
